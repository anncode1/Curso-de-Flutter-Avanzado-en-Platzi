/**
 * Represents a Mutation of a document. Different subclasses of Mutation will perform different
 * kinds of changes to a base document. For example, an FSTSetMutation replaces the value of a
 * document and an FSTDeleteMutation deletes a document.
 *
 * Subclasses of FSTMutation need to implement `applyToRemoteDocument:mutationResult:` and
 * `applyToLocalDocument:baseDocument:localWriteTime:` to implement the actual the behavior of
 * mutations as applied to some source document.
 *
 * In addition to the value of the document mutations also operate on the version. For local
 * mutations (mutations that haven't been committed yet), we preserve the existing version for Set,
 * Patch, and Transform mutations. For local deletes, we reset the version to 0.
 *
 * Here's the expected transition table.
 *
 * MUTATION           APPLIED TO            RESULTS IN
 *
 * SetMutation        Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * SetMutation        DeletedDocument(v3)   Document(v0)
 * SetMutation        nil                   Document(v0)
 * PatchMutation      Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * PatchMutation      DeletedDocument(v3)   DeletedDocument(v3)
 * PatchMutation      nil                   nil
 * TransformMutation  Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * TransformMutation  DeletedDocument(v3)   DeletedDocument(v3)
 * TransformMutation  nil                   nil
 * DeleteMutation     Document(v3)          DeletedDocument(v0)
 * DeleteMutation     DeletedDocument(v3)   DeletedDocument(v0)
 * DeleteMutation     nil                   DeletedDocument(v0)
 *
 * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as the resulting version
 * for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. As deletes have no explicit update time, we use the
 * commitTime of the WriteResponse for acknowledged deletes.
 *
 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check locally, we
 * return an `FSTUnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us the updated version.
 *
 * Note that FSTTransformMutations don't create Documents (in the case of being applied to an
 * FSTDeletedDocument), even though they would on the backend. This is because the client always
 * combines the FSTTransformMutations with a FSTSetMutation or FSTPatchMutation and we only want to
 * apply the transform if the prior mutation resulted in an FSTDocument (always true for an
 * FSTSetMutation, but not necessarily for an FSTPatchMutation).
