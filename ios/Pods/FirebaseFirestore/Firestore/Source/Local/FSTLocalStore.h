/**
 * Local storage in the Firestore client. Coordinates persistence components like the mutation
 * queue and remote document cache to present a latency compensated view of stored data.
 *
 * The LocalStore is responsible for accepting mutations from the Sync Engine. Writes from the
 * client are put into a queue as provisional Mutations until they are processed by the RemoteStore
 * and confirmed as having been written to the server.
 *
 * The local store provides the local version of documents that have been modified locally. It
 * maintains the constraint:
 *
 *  LocalDocument = RemoteDocument + Active(LocalMutations)
 *
 * (Active mutations are those that are enqueued and have not been previously acknowledged or
 * rejected).
 *
 * The RemoteDocument ("ground truth") state is provided via the applyChangeBatch method. It will
 * be some version of a server-provided document OR will be a server-provided document PLUS
 * acknowledged mutations:
 *
 *  RemoteDocument' = RemoteDocument + Acknowledged(LocalMutations)
 *
 * Note that this "dirty" version of a RemoteDocument will not be identical to a server base
 * version, since it has LocalMutations added to it pending getting an authoritative copy from the
 * server.
 *
 * Since LocalMutations can be rejected by the server, we have to be able to revert a LocalMutation
 * that has already been applied to the LocalDocument (typically done by replaying all remaining
 * LocalMutations to the RemoteDocument to re-apply).
 *
 * It also maintains the persistence of mapping queries to resume tokens and target ids.
 *
 * The LocalStore must be able to efficiently execute queries against its local cache of the
 * documents, to provide the initial set of results before any remote changes have been received.
