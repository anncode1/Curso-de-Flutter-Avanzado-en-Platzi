/**
 * FSTPersistence is the lowest-level shared interface to persistent storage in Firestore.
 *
 * FSTPersistence is used to create FSTMutationQueue and FSTRemoteDocumentCache instances backed
 * by persistence (which might be in-memory or LevelDB).
 *
 * FSTPersistence also exposes an API to create and commit FSTWriteGroup instances.
 * Implementations of FSTWriteGroup/FSTPersistence only need to guarantee that writes made
 * against the FSTWriteGroup are not made to durable storage until commitGroup:action: is called
 * here. Since memory-only storage components do not alter durable storage, they are free to ignore
 * the group.
 *
 * This contract is enough to allow the FSTLocalStore be be written independently of whether or not
 * the stored state actually is durably persisted. If persistent storage is enabled, writes are
 * grouped together to avoid inconsistent state that could cause crashes.
 *
 * Concretely, when persistent storage is enabled, the persistent versions of FSTMutationQueue,
 * FSTRemoteDocumentCache, and others (the mutators) will defer their writes into an FSTWriteGroup.
 * Once the local store has completed one logical operation, it commits the write group using
 * [FSTPersistence commitGroup:action:].
 *
 * When persistent storage is disabled, the non-persistent versions of the mutators ignore the
 * FSTWriteGroup and [FSTPersistence commitGroup:action:] is a no-op. This short-cut is allowed
 * because memory-only storage leaves no state so it cannot be inconsistent.
 *
 * This simplifies the implementations of the mutators and allows memory-only implementations to
 * supplement the persistent ones without requiring any special dual-store implementation of
 * FSTPersistence. The cost is that the FSTLocalStore needs to be slightly careful about the order
 * of its reads and writes in order to avoid relying on being able to read back uncommitted writes.
